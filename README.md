# dannylum-website
Here is the source code for [my website](http://dannylum.com) with the new [Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/)
look and feel created using the new [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org) framework.

I decided the best way for me to learn Angular Material is to rebuild and redesign my personal website using it. Which I also
rebuilt it in 2014 in AngularJS and Bootstrap 3 in order to learn them.
